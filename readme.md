<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Introducing the Peptonizer2000 - a tool that combines the capabilities of Unipept and PepGM to analyze
metaproteomic mass spectrometry-based samples. Originally designed for taxonomic inference of viral
mass spectrometry-based samples, we've extended PepGM's functionality to analyze metaproteomic samples by
retrieving taxonomic information from the Unipept database.

PepGM is a probabilistic graphical model developed by Tanja Holstein et al. that uses belief propagation to infer the taxonomic origin of peptides and taxa in viral samples.
You can learn more about PepGM at [GitHub](https://github.com/BAMeScience/PepGM) page.

Unipept, on the other hand, is a web-based metaproteomics analysis tool that provides taxonomic information for
identified peptides. To make it work seamlessly with PepGM, we've extended Unipept with new functionalities that
restrict the taxa queried and provide all potential taxonomic origins of the peptides queried. Check out more
information about Unipept [here](https://unipept.ugent.be/).

With the Peptonizer2000, you can look forward to a comprehensive and streamlined workflow that simplifies
the process of identifying peptides and their taxonomic origins in metaproteomic samples.

The Peptonizer2000 workflow is comprised of the following steps:

1. Query all identified peptides, provided by the user in a .tsv file, in the Unipept API,
   and restrict the taxonomic range queried based on any prior knowledge of the sample.
2. Assemble the peptide-taxon associations provided by Unipept into a bipartite graph,
   where peptides and taxa are represented by different nodes, and an edge is drawn between a peptide and a taxon
   if the peptide is part of the taxon's proteome.
3. Transform the bipartite graph into a factor graph using convolution trees and conditional probability table
   factors (CPD).
4. Run the belief propagation algorithm multiple times with different sets of CPD parameters until convergence,
   to obtain posterior probabilities of candidate taxa.
5. Use an empirically deduced metric to determine the ideal graph parameter set.
6. Output the top scoring taxa as a results barchart. The results are also available as comma-separated files
   for further downstream analysis or visualizations.

<!-- INPUT -->

## Input

* A .tsv file of your peptides output from any protoemic peptide search method. The first column should be the peptide, the second column it's score attributed by the search engine. An example is provided in test files. <br>
* A config file with your parameters for the peptonizer2000. A more detailed description of the configuration file can be found below. Additionally, an exemplary config file is provided in this repository.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

## Rust implementation
The core algorithm is implemented in Rust in the `peptonizer_rust` folder. Wheels are created for all major platforms so users can use the package on supported systems.

### Running as snakemake workflow
In order to run the Peptonizer2000 on your own system, you should install Conda, Mamba and all of its dependencies.
Follow the installation instructions step-by-step for an explanation of what you should do.

* Make sure that Conda and Mamba are installed. If these are not yet present on your system, you can follow the instructions on their [README](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge).
* Go to the "workflow" directory by executing `cd snakemake/workflow` from the terminal.
* Run `conda env create -f env.yml` (make sure to run this command from the workflow directory) in order to install all dependencies and create a new conda environment (which is named "peptonizer" by default).
* Run `mamba install -c conda-forge -c bioconda -n peptonizer snakemake` to install snakemake which is required to run the whole workflow from start-to-finish.
* Run `conda activate peptonizer` to switch the current Conda environment to the peptonizer environment you created earlier.
* Start the peptonizer with the command `snakemake --use-conda --cores 1`. If you have sufficient CPU and memory power available to your system, you can increase the amount of cores in order to speed up the workflow.

If you see the following error while installing dependencies:

```
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement peptonizer_rust (from versions: none)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for peptonizer_rust
```

then the workflow could not find a wheel for `peptonizer_rust` for your platform. To create one manually, expand the instructions below.

<details>
  <summary>Show manual wheel creation instructions</summary>

  - Change to the Rust package directory:

     ```bash
     cd peptonizer_rust
     ```

  - Download the rustup installer:

    ```bash
    curl -sSf -o rustup-init.sh https://sh.rustup.rs
    ```

  - Run the installer with defaults:

    ```bash
    sh rustup-init.sh -y
    ```

  - Make `cargo` available in this shell session:

    ```bash
    source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
    ```

  - Update the Rust toolchain to stable:

    ```bash
    rustup update
    ```

  - Install Linux build tools (Debian/Ubuntu example):

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y build-essential
    ```

  - Install `maturin` into the active Conda environment (run after `conda activate peptonizer`):

    ```bash
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
    python -m pip install maturin
    ```

  - Build the wheel for Python 3.12 (adjust `-i` if using a different Python):

    ```bash
    maturin build --release --out dist -i python3.12
    ```

  The command writes one or more `.whl` files to `peptonizer_rust/dist`.

</details>

### Configuration file

The Peptonizer2000 relies on a configuration file in `yaml` format to set up the workflow.
An example configuration file is provided in `config/config.yaml`. <br>
Do not change the config file location.

## Testing the Peptonizer
<!-- Testing -->

To test the Peptonizer2000 and see if it is set up correctly on your machine, we provide a test file under resources/test_files. This should be dowloaded automatically if you follow the installation instructions above. There are several test files from different metaproteomic samples. These are: <br>
- the samples S03, S05 and S11 of the [CAMPI study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-27542-8) searched against a sample specific database using X!Tandem and MS2Rescore. The original files are available through [PRIDE under PXD023217](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD023217/). 
- the sample U1 of uneven communities from a [metaproteomic benchmark study by Kleiner](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01544-x) searched against a sample specific database. The original files are available through [PRIDE under PXD006118](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD006118)
- the sample F07, a fecal sample, of the [CAMPI study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-27542-8) searched against the integrated gene catalog for the human gut using X!Tandem and MS2Rescore. The original files are available through [PRIDE under PXD023217](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD023217/). 

To execute a test run of the Peptonizer2000 using the provided files: 
 
 1. Follow the installation instructions above
 2. In the config file, make sure to point to the test sample you want to use. By default, this is S03
 3. Start to peptonize with the command `snakemake --use-conda --cores 1`. If you have sufficient CPU and memory power available to your system, you can increase the amount of cores in order to speed up the workflow.
